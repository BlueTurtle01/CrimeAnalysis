# CrimeAnalysis

# What does this repo do?
I analysed 2.11 million records for Crime in Los Angeles between 2010-2019 for interesting results. I started by conducting EDA to see what trends were present.

In the end I managed to statistically show that there is differences in the arrest rates for crimes committed against ethnic minorities and towards females. I also showed that certain areas of society are statistically more likely to be the victim of certain crimes.

# Things I have learnt from this project
I learnt how to create a basis map and a map that changes through time using the Folium package. I need to improve these maps to be able to do robust statistical analysis but for a first attempt I am proud of the overall visual EDA it gives. In future I would like to separate the areas into the 21 distinct boroughs and show the levels of crime on an area level rather than using the latitude and longitude.
