### Overall, the report is well-written. The structure of the report and the introduction might be potentially improved. It might be beneficial to include some rigorous statistical analysis in the report. Thank you for your hard work!

* **Introduction and data description**: The data are described under the "data retrieval" section. As for the introduction, it might be better to present more background about the topic and elaborate the motivation.  
* **Formulation of the research question**: The research objectives are cleared listed in the first section. It might be beneficial to formulate the research questions by adopting more of a 'popular science' rather than 'computer science' language.
* **Data acquisition**: Through the use of API. Functions are provided to output data in a JSON file.
* **Data cleaning and reshaping**: Data cleaning includes importing data from csv files, removing some irrelevant columns, checking and replacing missing values and sorting observations.
* **Visualisation**: Data visualisation includes line plots, barplots, heatmaps and an interactive map. Most of the figures are labelled. 
* **Modelling**: To be honest, I did not find much related to this part. But potentially, the student could apply time series models to predict the number of crimes.
* **Conclusion and overall structure**: The findings are summarized in detail and extensions of the study are also presented. The structure of the report might be potentially improved by numbering each section and subsection.
